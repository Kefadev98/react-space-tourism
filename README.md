Small Frontend Mentor Challenge created using React, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, and SCSS. To avoid the need to run a JSON server, I have provided a video as a brief demonstration of the website's functionality. I showcased the pagination I built using Redux and a custom hook, as well as the navigation between components using React Router.
